I am apart of the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program (wow thats long) and I love seeing that amount of women who are just as passionate about STEM. I am learning JavaScript outside of class and C++ in class. I love coding and I hope that I can turn it into a career. Until then, I will use this page to showcase all the side projects I'll work on to improve my skills!</p>
